3) GCD: recursively calculate Greatest Common Divisors of two number.
4) harmonic number: recursively calculate the n-th harmonic number.
5) logarithm: recursively calculate the integer part of the logarithm of a number in an arbitrary base.
6) man and max: recursively find the minimum and maximum values of an array.
7) palindrome: recursively check whether a given string is palindromic or not.
8) pascal: recursively calculate the n-th row of pascal's triangle.
9) product: recursively evaluate the value of two number multiplication.
10) reverse string: recursively find the reverse of a given string.
